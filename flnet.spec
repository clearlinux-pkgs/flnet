%description
Flnet provides the Amateur Radio Net Control Station operator with a real
time tool to assist him or her in managing the net activities.  A single
screen with multiple windows is used to allow rapid entry, search, pick
and display of all stations calling in to the net.  All operations on
the main screen are accomplished with keyboard entries only.  No mouse
action is required to perform the net control functions.  Experience
has shown that most net control operators prefer this method of operation
to improve the speed of entry and selection
